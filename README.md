# UCC-Dashboard-Automation

This program works with the Sample Excel workbook and automates the transfer of data into a SQLITE database.

The *main.py* automates the creation and initial insertion of data into the SQLITE DB

The *update_db.py* works with the already created SQLITE db and updates records for the week specified from the Excel file.
